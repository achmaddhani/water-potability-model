The distinction between potable water, which is safe for consumption, and non-potable water, which poses health risks, determined by the presence of certain chemicals. By employing classification model focused on the Recall metric, we can effectively predict the potability of water, ensuring its safety for consumption.')

            The dataset is well documented but has missing values. These missing values after exploration deemed MCAR and most likely due to the person in charge taking the water samples did not have the equipment to messure these missing values chemical levels. All the chemicals don't have a relationship with each other or a trend, and each of them are important because the PCA shows a linear relationship between number of features and the percentage of data kept. Most water sample has a ph of 5-9, has a quite high amount of chemicals like sulfate, chloramines and trihalomethanes which doesn't seem to have difference between the ones potable and non-potable. It can be assumed that the water samples are from environment that is scarce on really good drinkable water or a highly contaminated environment like a factory side of the city. The model that gives the best overall score is RandomForest which has a recall of 65% meaning, when predicting if the water is drinkable or not, it will be correct 65% of the time. There are few things to suggest for the future. The SVC model can be further searched if resources are available, there needed to be more potable water data since the data is imbalanced towards non-potable water and dataset potability validity needed to be checked by the author.
