[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/achmaddhani/water_potability_prediction)

**Objective:** 🎯
Water is essential for all forms of life, yet its quality can vary dramatically, with the potential to sustain health or cause disease. The distinction between potable water, which is safe for consumption 🥤, and non-potable water, which poses health risks, is determined by the presence of certain chemicals. By employing a classification model focused on the Recall metric, we can effectively predict the potability of water, ensuring its safety for consumption.

**Goals:** 🎯

- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understanding the correlation between the chemicals and their relationship with potability.
- 🤖 **Classification Model:** Able to create a classification model to predict water potability.

**Tools:** 🛠️

- **Language:** Python 
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, Numpy, missingno, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, Imblearn

**Dataset**: [Keggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
