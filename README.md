# Water Potability Classification Project üíß

[Webapps Deployment](https://huggingface.co/spaces/achmaddhani/water_potability)

## Objective üéØ
Water is essential for life, yet its quality varies greatly. This project aims to distinguish between potable and non-potable water using a classification model. Focusing on the Recall metric, aiming to ensure the safety and potability of water for consumption.

## Project Overview üìñ
This project leverages machine learning to predict water potability. We use various classification models to analyze water quality based on chemical composition, aiming to safeguard public health by identifying safe drinking water.

## Dataset and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç
- The dataset contains essential chemical properties of water samples, with some missing values.
- EDA reveals a pH range of 5-9 and a high presence of chemicals like sulfate and chloramines.
- No significant difference in chemical composition between potable and non-potable samples suggests challenging water conditions.

## Model and Performance üíª
- Best performing model: RandomForest Classifier with a Recall of 65%.
- Models tested include RandomForest, AdaBoost, SVC, KNeighborsClassifier, and DecisionTreeClassifier.
